### byte, short, int, long

Learning about four of the eight primitive data types

Also learning GitHub and command line. I need to make some adjustments in this repo's files. 

I am learning to put .idea files into .gitignore

I may even keep the .idea files in a local file. Still learning about all this.

I had accidently created a subfolder with the same code. I learned how to clean a file.

I learned how to use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage a file

I also had to use the rm -f to force a file removal. Stil learning to straighten it all out.
